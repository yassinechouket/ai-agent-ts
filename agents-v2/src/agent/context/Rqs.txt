How is the usage percentage calculated for tracking token consumption against a model's context window limit?


The usage percentage is calculated by dividing the total 
tokens (input and output) by the context window token limit,
then multiplying by 100. The formula is: (total tokens / context window limit) × 100.
This provides a percentage showing how much of the available context window has been used.

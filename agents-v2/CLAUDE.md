# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

# Course Development Workflow

This repo contains a finished AI agent app. Course content is developed by working **backwards** from the complete app to a starter template.

## Branch Strategy

- `done` - The complete, finished app (current state)
- Each lesson branch contains the **solution for the previous lesson**
- Work backwards: `done` → `09-hitl` → `08-shell-tool` → ... → `01-intro-to-agents` → starter template

## Process for Each Lesson

Starting from the current branch (which has the complete code for that lesson):

1. **Create the "done" branch first** (only once at the start)
   ```bash
   git checkout -b done
   git push -u origin done
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **For each lesson (working backwards from 09 to 01):**

   a. **Identify the code** related to the current lesson topic

   b. **Copy ALL the code** that will be removed into the corresponding notes file in `notes/XX-Lesson-Name.md`
      - Include complete code blocks with file paths
      - Format for easy copy/paste during live coding
      - Add lecture notes and explanations

   c. **Remove the code** from the app

   d. **Verify the app still works** (or gracefully handles the missing feature)

   e. **Commit the changes** with a clear message

   f. **Create and push a new branch** for the lesson:
      ```bash
      git checkout -b XX-lesson-name
      git push -u origin XX-lesson-name
      git checkout main
      ```

3. **Continue backwards** to the next lesson until you reach a starter template

## Notes File Format

Each notes file in `notes/` should contain:

```markdown
# Lesson Title

## Overview
Brief explanation of what this lesson covers

## Key Concepts
- Concept 1
- Concept 2

## Code

### filename.ts
\`\`\`typescript
// Complete code that was removed
// Students can copy/paste this
\`\`\`

### another-file.ts
\`\`\`typescript
// More code
\`\`\`

## Exercises
Any exercises or challenges for students
```

## Lesson Order (backwards)

| `03-single-turn-evals` | Single Turn Evals | Single-turn evaluation code |
| `02-tool-calling` | Tool Calling | Tool definitions and calling logic |
| `01-intro-to-agents` | Intro to Agents | Basic agent structure |
| starter | Starter template | What students begin with |
- do not add any other code other than the code I removed to the lesson, use git status to see that code. ADD NOTHING ELSE. you are only to help make lecture notes and add that code to the notes, no other code. do not look in the repo for any other code other than the code I removed
